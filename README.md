A quick summary spewed out on 04-04-2024 :

This codebase was developed by Scott Wallace. https://royal.w2marketing.biz

Royal World Socket is a chat based web application developed for Royal Splendor. 
The core of this application should serve its visitors multi chatroom options, permission and club level based, chat should the first consideration in any module developed in this SPA.
Chat rooms upon deployment will be controled and created via CRUD in the admin panel. V2 will look into user based and custom rooms.
Video is mandatorty. Some chat rooms may nned to render video for our users this is a flashpoint between Zoom api, socket-io, or websocketGL. V1 will only need to broadcast video from a few deligates of the owner of this app.

All clients will be paid clients, there are no free permissions other than non auth copy to promote a membership.
Avatars and Chat Room customizations will available as seasons progress after launch, and yup we will micro tranact customizations to the UX. Design and 3d models will be manual until a V2. 
I hope to create an interface to exand on custom creation community for chat and gaming parlotr. 


GAMING threeJS blender vue/vite a module within the webapp which will be our portal to bingo and dominoes.
Archaic Text Based Gaming method, where we can attach game state and logic to a very very limitied collection of aniamtions. 


ECOMMERCE will manage via shoppify api and a jewel wallet will credit within the web app using shoppifys webhooks. This is the prefered inventory and ecom for our Client.

This codebase should be refactored and moularized to scale up the microservices, and scale the UI horizontally via node balnacer. 
I have a deploymane bat of this code prepared, and am tracking updates for containerization and auto deploy options moving forward.
Authentication via Passport.js, google cloud console.
Local password managed and serialized user via passport. 
Mongo sessions hold session's key metadata.
socket_io requests the user object to emit to to clients effectively pulling thumbnails to broadcast or changing the class in the DOM.
This iteration of chat will refactor to modularize changing chat rooms and theoir specific capabilities.
all front end is leveraged using .ejs as a templating engine while vanilla js handles the UI very messily ATM.
Ultimately threeJS plays nicely with blender for scene, modeling, and rigging of 3d objects. CannonJs or AmmoJs for physics, socketio controls event listeneers, and Game State Logics are handled on the webapp server
Implimentation of VUE/VITE will be necesarry to scale state and UI management and maintain imports and ultimately move away from require. JWT will handle auth if sessions bears too much weight.
possible microserviced AUTH, CHAT, NOTIFICATIONS, GAME_SERVER_IO
all design is using css and a SASS compiler from scss

Royal World Socket: A Multi-Chatroom Web Application

Release Date: 04-04-2024
Developer: Scott Wallace
Website: https://royal.w2marketing.biz
Overview

Royal World Socket is a cutting-edge chat-based web application tailored for Royal Splendor. It prioritizes providing users with diverse, multi-chatroom options based on permission and club levels. Each chatroom, central to our Single Page Application (SPA), aims for seamless communication and engagement.
Key Features

    Multi-Chatrooms: Initially controlled by admins via CRUD operations. Future updates (V2) will introduce user-created and custom rooms.
    Video Integration: Essential for certain chatrooms, integrating technologies like Zoom API, socket.io, or WebSocketGL. V1 focuses on video broadcasts from selected delegates.
    Exclusivity: Services are available to paid clients only, with enticing non-authenticated previews to encourage membership.
    Customization: Post-launch, we will introduce seasonal avatar and chat room customizations, supported by microtransactions.
    Gaming Module: Incorporates games like bingo and dominoes using technologies like Three.js, Blender, and Vue/Vite. A nod to classic text-based gaming with limited animations.
    E-commerce Integration: Utilizes Shopify API for inventory and sales, integrating a jewel wallet for in-app credits and transactions.

Development and Architecture

    Scalability: The codebase is designed for modular refactoring to enhance microservices and UI scalability, including load balancing.
    Authentication: Utilizes Passport.js for authentication, with Google Cloud Console for additional support. Sessions are managed through MongoDB.
    Front-End: Utilizes EJS for templating, with a plan to transition messy vanilla JS to Vue/Vite for improved state and UI management.
    3D Modeling: Three.js and Blender for 3D scenes, with CannonJs or AmmoJs for physics. Socket.io manages event listeners and game state logic.
    Future Plans: Incorporation of JWT for authentication, potential microservice expansion in areas like notifications and game server management.

Deployment and Versioning

    Current State: The application includes a deployment batch script, with ongoing efforts towards containerization and automated deployment.
    Version Notes: This documentation refers to V1. Future versions will focus on expanding user engagement, customization, and gaming features.
