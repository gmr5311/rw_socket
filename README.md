Release Date: 04-04-2024
Developer: Scott Wallace
Website: https://royal.w2marketing.biz
Overview

Royal World Socket is a cutting-edge chat-based web application tailored for Royal Splendor. It prioritizes providing users with diverse, multi-chatroom options based on permission and club levels. Each chatroom, central to our Single Page Application (SPA), aims for seamless communication and engagement.
Key Features

    Multi-Chatrooms: Initially controlled by admins via CRUD operations. Future updates (V2) will introduce user-created and custom rooms.
    Video Integration: Essential for certain chatrooms, integrating technologies like Zoom API, socket.io, or WebSocketGL. V1 focuses on video broadcasts from selected delegates.
    Exclusivity: Services are available to paid clients only, with enticing non-authenticated previews to encourage membership.
    Customization: Post-launch, we will introduce seasonal avatar and chat room customizations, supported by microtransactions.
    Gaming Module: Incorporates games like bingo and dominoes using technologies like Three.js, Blender, and Vue/Vite. A nod to classic text-based gaming with limited animations.
    E-commerce Integration: Utilizes Shopify API for inventory and sales, integrating a jewel wallet for in-app credits and transactions.

Development and Architecture

    Scalability: The codebase is designed for modular refactoring to enhance microservices and UI scalability, including load balancing.
    Authentication: Utilizes Passport.js for authentication, with Google Cloud Console for additional support. Sessions are managed through MongoDB.
    Front-End: Utilizes EJS for templating, with a plan to transition messy vanilla JS to Vue/Vite for improved state and UI management.
    3D Modeling: Three.js and Blender for 3D scenes, with CannonJs or AmmoJs for physics. Socket.io manages event listeners and game state logic.
    Future Plans: Incorporation of JWT for authentication, potential microservice expansion in areas like notifications and game server management.

Deployment and Versioning

    Current State: The application includes a deployment batch script, with ongoing efforts towards containerization and automated deployment.
    Version Notes: This documentation refers to V1. Future versions will focus on expanding user engagement, customization, and gaming features.
