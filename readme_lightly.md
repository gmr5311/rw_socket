# Royal World Socket README

## Quick Overview

Developed by Scott Wallace on a day when coffee was particularly good (04-04-2024), this codebase powers a web application for the sophisticated audience of Royal Splendor. It's not just any chat application; it's the chat application where every message feels like it's delivered on a silver platter.

## What's Inside

### The Chat Rooms
- **Multi-chatroom Options:** Chat is king here. Rooms are initially set up by admins but keep an eye out for user-created spaces in the sequel.
- **Video? Yes, Please:** Some chats are more than just text. We're mixing technologies like a DJ mixes tracks to bring video into the chatrooms. For now, selected delegates can broadcast, making everyone else feel a bit like they're on a reality TV show.

### Exclusivity & Customization
- **VIP Only:** This is a members-only club where avatars and chat room themes get fancier with time. Expect seasonal wardrobe updates for your digital self.
- **Microtransactions:** Because everyone loves a bit of customization. Future updates will allow for even more personal touches. We're thinking along the lines of "Pimp My Chatroom."

### The Extra Fun Bits
- **Gaming:** For those who think chat is too mainstream, we've got games. Think old-school text adventures meet modern tech.
- **E-commerce Integration:** We're making shopping cool again with a touch of digital wallet magic. Because why leave the chat to shop?

## Technical Mumbo Jumbo

- **Built for the Future:** Modular design means we're ready to grow. We're like the bamboo of the web app world.
- **Authentic Authentication:** Passport.js is our bouncer, keeping things safe and sound.
- **Front-End Finesse:** We started with EJS and vanilla JS, but we're eyeing Vue/Vite for a glow-up.
- **3D and Gaming:** Our application does yoga: it's flexible. Three.js, Blender, CannonJs, or AmmoJs – we use whatever it takes to bring gaming to life.
- **Looking Ahead:** We're dreaming big – JWT, microservices, and more user-generated content are on the horizon.

## Join the Party

This isn't just another web application; it's a Royal Splendor party, and you're invited. Grab your digital party hat, and let's make some internet history together.
